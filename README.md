# React Wordpress Theme

Basic wordpress theme that runs on React and Redux.

## Installation

1. Clone project into your Wordpress `/wp-content/themes/` directory
2. Turn on `Cmccullough React` in `Appearance -> Themes`

## Customizing

Need to test how this will handle being a child theme first, but if you want to customize this directly:

1. `cd` into this theme's directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`
4. Start coding
